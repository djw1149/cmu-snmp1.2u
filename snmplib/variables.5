.SH NAME
    variables - Format of specifying variable names to SNMP tools.
.SH SYNOPSIS
    system.sysdescr.0
.SH DESCRIPTION
Variable names are in the format of Object Identifiers (ASN.1).  There
are several methods of representation. Each variable name is given in
the format of A.B.C.D..., where A, B, C, and D are subidentifiers in
one of two forms of notation.  Each subidentifier may be encoded as a
decimal integer, or a symbol as found in the RFC 1213 MIB.  The case of
the symbols is not significant.
.br
If there is no leading "." in the variable name, the name will be formed
as if having been preceded with "iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib.".  A "." must
be placed before the first variable if the user is to fully specify the name.
For example:
.PP
.I 1.1.0  system.sysDescr.0 and 1.sysDescr.0
.PP
all refer to the same variable name.  Likewise:
.PP
.I .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib.system.sysdescr.0 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.sysdescr.0
.PP
All refer to the same variable name.
.PP

The description of the variables in the MIB is given in a file named
in the environment variable
.I "MIBFILE"
if that environment variable is defined.  If that environment variable
is defined but the specified file doesn't exist, then it will complain and
exit.
Otherwise the description comes
from a file named
.I "cmu-snmp-mib.txt"
directory given in the environment variable
.I "ANMCONFDIR"
if that environment variable is defined,
in the current directory, or in directory
.I /etc/\.
The files are in the ASN.1 notation and use the OBJECT TYPE macro
defined in RFC 1212.  Most of the file describing the RFC 1213 MIB is
pulled out of RFC 1213 without change.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
RFC 1065, RFC 1066, RFC 1067, RFC 1212, RFC 1213, ISO IS 8824(ASN.1)
.SH BUGS
The parser of the
.I "mib.txt"
file is not expected to handle bizarre
(although correct) interpretations of the ASN.1 notation.
