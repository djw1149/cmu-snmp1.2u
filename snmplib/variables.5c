     Variable names are  in  the  format  of  Object  Identifiers
     (ASN.1).   There are several methods of representation. Each
     variable name is given in the format of A.B.C.D..., where A,
     B,  C, and D are subidentifiers in one of two forms of nota-
     tion.  Each  subidentifier  may  be  encoded  as  a  decimal
     integer, or a symbol as found in the RFC 1213 MIB.  The case
     of the symbols is not significant.
     If there is no leading "." in the variable  name,  the  name
     will   be   formed   as   if   having   been  preceded  with
     "iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib.".   A  "."  must  be  placed
     before  the  first  variable if the user is to fully specify
     the name.  For example:

     _1._1._0 _s_y_s_t_e_m._s_y_s_D_e_s_c_r._0 _a_n_d _1._s_y_s_D_e_s_c_r._0

     all refer to the same variable name.  Likewise:

     ._1._3._6._1._2._1._1._1._0
     ._i_s_o._o_r_g._d_o_d._i_n_t_e_r_n_e_t._m_g_m_t._m_i_b._s_y_s_t_e_m._s_y_s_d_e_s_c_r._0
     ._1._3._6._1._2._1._1._s_y_s_d_e_s_c_r._0

     All refer to the same variable name.

     The description of the variables in the MIB is  given  in  a
     file  named  in  the  environment  variable  _M_I_B_F_I_L_E if that
     environment variable is defined.  If that environment  vari-
     able  is  defined but the specified file doesn't exist, then
     it will complain and exit.  Otherwise the description  comes
     from  a  file  named _c_m_u-_s_n_m_p-_m_i_b._t_x_t directory given in the
     environment variable _A_N_M_C_O_N_F_D_I_R if that environment variable
     is defined, in the current directory, or in directory /_e_t_c/.
     The files are in the ASN.1 notation and use the OBJECT  TYPE
     macro  defined in RFC 1212.  Most of the file describing the
     RFC 1213 MIB is pulled out of RFC 1213 without change.

     The parser of the _m_i_b._t_x_t file is  not  expected  to  handle
     bizarre  (although  correct)  interpretations  of  the ASN.1
     notation.
