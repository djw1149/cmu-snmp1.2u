  The files in this directory comprise the 1.2u release of the CMU
SNMP distribution.  The 'u' stands for 'Unofficial', since CMU has not
officially gone through the code.  This is mostly a compilation of bug
fixes made by people across the net.  

This release has been in beta test since early March 1992.

This release includes the SNMP/ASN.1 library, many client
applications, and supporting documentation.  The snmp agent for the
Kinetics box is included in this distribution, but the KIP code it
links against is not.

This code was written with efficiency and portability in mind.  The
applications compile and run on the following systems: 
	- Sun3/60 running SUNOS 4.1.1,
	- Sun SparcStation2 running SUNOS 4.1.1,
	- Vax running Ultrix 4.1 (snmpd and snmptrapd were not tested),
	- Decstation running Ultrix 4.2 (snmpd and snmptrapd were not tested),

All applications except for the snmp agent and the snmproute program
will compile and run on a Sun IPX running SunOS 5.0 beta (but the
compile will fail trying to do a 'ranlib'-- just type 'make' again to
continue it).

Most applications are expected to run on any system with a Berkeley
socket interface.

The agent compiles into about 10 KB of 68000 code.  The machine independent
portions of this agent also run on CMU's IBM PC/AT based router.

The applications are designed to be useful in the real world.  Snmpnetstat
is a port of the Berkeley Unix netstat that gathers it's information using
SNMP.  (Many people will enjoy "snmpnetstat mygateway public -r").  Snmpstatus
collects several pieces of information and presents them in a useful format
and is good for everyday status monitoring.  The rest of the tools are simpler,
but still interpret input and output symbolicly (they can be used without
referencing the RFC's!).

For instance, 
snmpnetstat mygateway public -r returns:

snmpstatus returns:
[128.2.56.220]=>[Kinetics Fastpath2] Up: 1 day, 4:43:31
Recv/Trans packets - Interface: 262874/39867 | IP 47432/34587

The rest of the applications typically present a variable in a form similar
to the following:
Name: interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.1 -> INTEGER: ethernet-csmacd(6)

The parsing and printing of symbolic object identifiers and the
printing of typed variables is driven by a database that describes the
MIB.  The MIB database is now retrieved from a text file in the ASN.1
format used in the RFC1213 MIB (concise mib format).  This makes
adding new (enterprise specific) mibs to the database very simple.
Initially, the mib.txt file contains a discription of the RFC 1213
MIB.  Steve Waldbusser had help in optimizing the parser from Phil
Lapsley of Berkeley (Thanks Phil!).  Partial concise MIB parsing
support was provided by Shiva Systems.  The concise MIB parsing
support was finished by David Waitzman at BBN.

For further information, please consult the man pages.  There are man
pages for each of the applications, as well as for the Application
Programming Interface (API).

The API has been redesigned to present a very convenient and useful
asynchronous interface to the SNMP transport.  In addition,
snmp_client.c contains a toolkit of routines that simplify writing
client applications.  In particular, there is a synchronous interface
built on top of the asyncronous interface that makes writing
applications very easy.

Berkeley 4.3 netstat, and is therefore also copyrighted by Berkeley.
