Version .91:  Changed the ASN type for the types: Counter, Ipaddress, gauge,
timeticks, and opaque.  The SMI defines them as application specific types,
not ASN_INTEGER and ASN_OCTET_STRING.

Version 1.0: Added snmpnetstat, snmptrap, snmptrapd.  Everything runs on a new
API that has an asynchronous interface.  Most old hard-coded limits are either
non-existent or much larger than necessary.  The mib module now gets it's data
by parsing a text file in the same ASN.1 format as is given in RFC1066.

Version 1.1b: <Not documented>

Version 1.2u: Added Concise MIB parsing support to the snmp library
and to the snmptranslate program.  New mib.txt file that is an
almost-direct extract from RFC1213.  Added the snmproute,
snmptranslate, and snmpdelta programs.  Assorted bug fixes.
Integers are now the only signed numbers.  The snmptrap program is
heavily revised-- it now can pass user-specified varbindings in the
trap PDU.  Some nice snmpnetstat additions from Havard Eidnes
(he@idt.unit.no).
