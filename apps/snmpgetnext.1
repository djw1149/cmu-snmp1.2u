.SH NAME
snmpgetnext - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GET NEXT Requests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
snmpgetnext host community variable-name [variable-name]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Snmpget is an SNMP application that uses the GET NEXT Request to query for
information on a network entity.  One or more object
identifiers may be given as arguments on the command line.
Each variable name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables (5).
For each one, the variable that is lexicographicly "next" in the remote entity's
MIB will be returned.
.PP
The
.I host
specification may be either a host name or an internet address
specified in "dot notation"
.PP
The
.I community
specifies the community name for the transaction with the remote system.
.PP
For example
.PP
.I snmpgetnext netdev-kbox.cc.cmu.edu public system.sysdescr system.sysUpTime
.PP
will retrieve the variables sysDescr.0 and sysUpTime.0:
.PP
.I Name: system.sysDescr.0
.br
.I OCTET STRING- (ascii):	Kinetics FastPath2
.PP
.I Name: system.sysUpTime.0
.br
.I Timeticks: (2270351) 6:18:23
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an error
message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what way the request was malformed.
.PP
Adding a "-d" to the argument list will cause the application to dump input and output packets.
