.SH NAME
snmptrap - Send an SNMP TRAP message to a host.
.SH SYNOPSIS
snmptrap host community trap-type specific-type [ -a agent-addr ] [-e enterprise-oid] [-d] [-r repeat-count#] [-P port]
.SH DESCRIPTION
snmptrap is an SNMP application that forms and sends an SNMP TRAP message to
a host.
.PP
The
.I host
specification may be either a host name or an internet address
specified in "dot notation"
.PP
The
.I community
specifies the community name for the transaction with the remote system.
.PP
The
.I trap-type
and
.I specific-type
are integers that specify the type of trap message being sent.
.PP
The optional argument
.I -a agent-addr
can be used to change the address from which the trap reports it is being 
sent.  Otherwise the sending host\'s address is used.
.PP
The optional argument
.I -e enterprise-oid
can be used to specify the enterprise object id of the device emitting 
the trap.  The default is 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.1.1.
.PP
The optional argument
.I -r repeat-count#
can be used to specify a repeat count to send the specified trap more than
once.  This is very useful for testing trap receivers.  The traps are sent
very close together in time.
.PP
The
.I -P port_number
option sets the UDP port number to which to send the trap.  If not 
present, the standard SNMP value of 162 is used.
.PP
After the command line arguments are read and parsed, the program will
prompt for the entry of a list of variables to send in the
VarBindingList in the TRAP PDU.
It will prompt with:
.PP
.I Please enter the variable name:
.PP
At this point you can enter one or more variable names, one per line.
Type just a blank line at that prompt to send the TRAP PDU and exit.
Each variable name is given in the format specified in
.I variables (5).
The prompt:
.PP
.I Please enter variable type [i|s|x|d|n|o|t|a]: 
.PP
requests the type of the variable be entered.  Type "i" for an
integer, "s" for an displayable string,
and "n" for a null value. (more...)
.br
At this point a value will be prompted for:
.PP
.I Please enter the value: 
.PP

If this is an integer value, just type the integer (in decimal).  If
it is a string, type in the string. (more...)

For example
.PP
.br
.I snmptrap nic.andrew.cmu.edu public 0 0
.br
.I Please enter the variable name: system.sysdescr.0
.br
.I Please enter variable type [i|s|x|d|n|o|t|a]: s
.br
.I Please enter the value: Unix 4.3BSD-Reno
.br
.I Please enter the variable name: 
.PP
Will send a trap with one variable.
.PP
The defined trap types are:
.TP
.B 0
coldStart \- signifies that the sending protocol entity is
reinitializing itself such that the agent\'s configuration or the
protocol entity implementation may be altered.
.TP
.B 1
warmStart \- signifies that the sending protocol entity is
reinitializing itself such that neither the agent configuration nor
the protocol entity implementation is altered.
.TP
.B 2
linkDown \- signifies that the sending protocol entity
recognizes a failure in one of the communication links represented in
the agent\'s configuration.
.TP
.B 3
linkUp \- signifies that the sending protocol entity
recognizes that one of the communication links represented in the
agent\'s configuration has come up.
.TP
.B 4
authenticationFailure \- signifies that the sending protocol
entity is the addressee of a protocol message that is not properly
authenticated.  While implementations of the SNMP must be capable of
generating this trap, they must also be capable of suppressing the
emission of such traps via an implementation-specific mechanism.
.TP
.B 5
egpNeighborLoss \- signifies that an EGP neighbor for whom
the sending protocol entity was an EGP peer has been marked down and
the peer relationship no longer obtains.
.TP
.B 6
enterpriseSpecific \- signifies that the sending protocol
entity recognizes that some enterprise-specific event has occurred.
The specific-trap field identifies the particular trap which
occurred.
.PP
Adding a "-d" to the argument list will cause the application to dump the output packet.
