.SH NAME
snmpwalk - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GET Next Requests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
snmpwalk host community [variable-name]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Snmpwalk is an SNMP application that uses GET NEXT Requests to query for a tree
of information about a network entity.
.PP
The
.I host
specification may be either a host name or an internet address
specified in "dot notation"
.PP
The
.I community
specifies the community name for the transaction with the remote system.
.PP
A variable may also be given on the
command line.  This variable specifies which portion of the object identifier
space will be searched using GET NEXT Requests.  All variables in the subtree
below the given variable are queried and their values presented to the user.
Each variable name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables (5).
.PP
If the "variable-name" argument is not present, snmpwalk will search the whole Internet MIB.
.PP
For example
.PP
.I snmpwalk netdev-kbox.cc.cmu.edu public system
.PP
will retrieve the variables sysDescr.0 and sysObjectID.0 and sysUpTime.0:
.PP
.I Name: system.sysDescr.0
.br
.I OCTET STRING- (ascii):	Kinetics FastPath2
.PP
.I Name: system.sysObjectID.0
.br
.I OBJECT IDENTIFIER:  .iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises.CMU.sysID.CMU-KIP
.PP
.I Name: system.sysUpTime.0
.br
.I Timeticks: (2291082) 6:21:50
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an error
packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to pinpoint why
the request was malformed.
.PP
If the tree search causes attempts to search beyond the end of the MIB, a message
will be displayed:
.PP
.I End of MIB.
.PP
Adding a "-d" to the argument list will cause the application to dump input and output packets.
