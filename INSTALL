Installation instructions for CMU SNMP release 1.2:

Untar the release into some directory tree.

Cd to that directory.  The rest of the instructions will use the variable
TOP as the name.

Edit the following Makefiles:

	$TOP/snmplib/Makefile
	$TOP/apps/Makefile
	$TOP/apps/snmpnetstat/Makefile

Find the line that defines CFLAGS.  If you are not running on a BSD 4.3
compliant system, remove the "-DBSD4_3" flag.  Modify "-g" as 
appropriate (perhaps replace it with "-O").  For an Ultrix 4.2 system, add 
"-DULTRIX42" to CFLAGS.

In the top level directory ($TOP), type "make".

Set the environment variable MIBFILE to $TOP/mib.txt.  This will
enable the applications to find the mib description.  See the man page
variables(5) in $TOP/man for more information on finding the mib
description file.

Test the applications in $TOP/apps and $TOP/apps/snmpnetstat.  The TEST.sh
shell script can help.  Assuming you're on the Internet, you can type
"TEST.sh $TOP/apps 128.2.1.8 public" to run some example tests (you can
substitute any addressable SNMP device for 128.2.1.8, and change "public" 
for the appropriate community string).

In the top level directory ($TOP), type "make install" to install the
programs in $TOP/bin.

When you are really ready to install everything: Copy the man pages in
$TOP/man into your appropriate system's man directory tree.  Copy the
applications from $TOP/bin into the appropriate place.  Copy mib.txt to
some standard place, perhaps /etc/mib.txt or if not using /etc/mib.txt
then set up an environment variable MIBFILE that points to where
mib.txt is located.

Remember that the snmp agent "snmpd" and the snmp trap receiver "snmptrapd"
must run as root.  Perhaps you want to run "snmpd" from your system's boot
script (/etc/rc.local on BSD Unix based systems)?
