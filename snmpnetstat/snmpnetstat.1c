     The _s_n_m_p_n_e_t_s_t_a_t command symbolically displays the values  of
     various  network-related information retrieved from a remote
     system using the SNMP protocol.  There are a number of  out-
     put  formats,  depending  on the options for the information
     presented.  The first form of the command displays a list of
     active  sockets.   The  second  form  presents the values of
     other network-related information according  to  the  option
     selected.  Using the third form, with an _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l specified,
     _s_n_m_p_n_e_t_s_t_a_t  will  continuously  display   the   information
     regarding  packet  traffic  on the configured network inter-
     faces.  The fourth form displays statistics about the  named
     protocol.

     The _h_o_s_t specification may be  either  a  host  name  or  an
     internet address specified in "dot notation"

     The _c_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_y specifies the community name for the  transac-
     tion with the remote system.

     The options have the following meaning:

     ----aaaa    With the default display, show the state of all  sock-
          ets;  normally sockets used by server processes are not
          shown.

     ----iiii    Show the state of all of  the  interfaces.   Interface
          names  may  be  followed by a flag.  A @@@@ indicates that
          both the OPER and ADMIN status variables indicate  "not
          up",  whereas  a  ****  indicates that only OPER status is
          "not up".

     ----IIII _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
          Show information only about this  interface  (named  by
          the  ifDescr  variable or named by the ifIndex variable
          if the -n flag is also specified).  Use with an  _i_n_t_e_r_-
          _v_a_l  as described below to display periodic information
          about one interface.

      ---- nnnn    Show  network   addresses   as   numbers   (normally
          _s_n_m_p_n_e_t_s_t_a_t   interprets   addresses  and  attempts  to
          display them symbolically).  This option  may  be  used
          with any of the display formats.

     ----pppp _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
          Show statistics  about  _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l,  which  is  either  a
          well-known  name  for  a  protocol  or an alias for it.
          Some protocol names and aliases are listed in the  file
          /_e_t_c/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s.   A  null response typically means that
          there are no interesting numbers to report.   The  pro-
          gram  will  complain if _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l is unknown or if there
          is no statistics routine for it.

     ----ssss    Show per-protocol statistics.

     ----rrrr    Show the routing tables.  When ---- ssss  is  also  present,
          show routing statistics instead.

     The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and
     remote  addresses,  protocol,  and the internal state of the
     protocol.  Address formats are of the form ``host.port''  or
     ``network.port''  if  a socket's address specifies a network
     but no specific host address.  When known the host and  net-
     work  addresses  are displayed symbolically according to the
     data bases /_e_t_c/_h_o_s_t_s and /_e_t_c/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, respectively.  If a
     symbolic name for an address is unknown, or if the ----nnnn option
     is specified, the address is printed numerically,  according
     to  the  address family.  For more information regarding the
     Internet ``dot format,'' refer to _i_n_e_t(3N).  Unspecified, or
     ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.

     The interface display provides a table of cumulative statis-
     tics  regarding packets transferred, errors, and collisions.
     The network addresses  of  the  interface  and  the  maximum
     transmission unit (``mtu'') are also displayed.

     The routing table display indicates the available routes and
     their  status.  Each route consists of a destination host or
     network and a gateway to use  in  forwarding  packets.   The
     flags  field shows the state of the route (``U'' if ``up''),
     whether the route is to a gateway (``G''), whether the route
     was  created  dynamically by a redirect (``D''), and whether
     the route has been modified by a redirect  (``M'').   Direct
     routes  are created for each interface attached to the local
     host; the gateway field for such entries shows  the  address
     of  the  outgoing  interface.  The interface entry indicates
     the network interface utilized for the route.

     When _s_n_m_p_n_e_t_s_t_a_t is invoked with an  _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l  argument,  it
     displays  a  running  count of statistics related to network
     interfaces.  This display consists of a column for the  pri-
     mary  interface and a column summarizing information for all
     interfaces.  The primary  interface  may  be  replaced  with
     another  interface  with  the  -_I option.  The first line of
     each screen of information contains a summary since the sys-
     tem  was  last  rebooted.   Subsequent  lines of output show
